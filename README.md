## Installation

To use the scripts for this project, you will need to install Tampermonkey, which is a free browser extension.

### Prerequisites

- any Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Opera / Opera GX.

### Install Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey is a userscript manager that allows you to manage and run userscripts. To install Tampermonkey on your browser, follow these steps:

#### Google Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers

1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/?hl=en).
2. Use the search bar to find "Tampermonkey".
3. Locate the Tampermonkey extension in the search results.
4. Click on 'Add to Chrome' to install the extension.
5. A pop-up window will appear detailing the permissions required by the extension. Review the permissions and if you agree, click 'Add extension'.

After installation, the Tampermonkey icon should appear in your browser's extension area, indicating that it is ready to use. Now you can proceed to add userscripts and enhance your browsing experience.

### Step 1: Create a New Script

1. Click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser's extension area.
2. Choose 'Create a new script...' from the dropdown menu. This will open the Tampermonkey script editor.

### Step 2: Paste the Code

1. In the Tampermonkey script editor, clear any pre-filled template if present.
2. Copy the entire code from `Dyslexic-vine.js`.
3. Paste the code into the Tampermonkey script editor.

### Step 3: Save and Activate

1. To save the script, press `Ctrl + S` or click on the disk icon to save the script in Tampermonkey.
2. Once saved, the script should be active by default. If not, ensure the script is enabled in the Tampermonkey dashboard.

### Step 4: Reload Amazon Page

1. Navigate to the Amazon page where you want the script to run.
2. Simply reload the page by pressing `F5` or clicking the reload button in your browser.
3. The userscript should now be operational, and you should see the changes applied by `Dyslexic-vine.js`.
